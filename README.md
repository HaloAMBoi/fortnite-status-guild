This project, created by Halo_AM_Boi, sends messages through a Discord bot to a defined alert channel specified in the project's .env file. It is set to only work in the alert channel, including all commands.

There are also commands (as mentioned before), these are
***
* "/status": To see the status of Epic Servers
* "/upcoming-maintenance": To check for any upcoming maintenance
* "help": To see commands
***

The bot works by contacting the Epic Status API; as such, this doesn't violate any TOS or T&C.
